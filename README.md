# InputTest
Minimum working example for showing error in validating HTML generated by Blazor

# Description
The default component InputText (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Components/Web/src/Forms/InputText.cs) in .NET 6 and .NET 7 generates an invalid HTML-Tag.

The input tag is defined as a void element, which must not be closed. In this minimum working example the default Blazor template in .NET 7 is used. The only edit is in the index page (index.razor), where a InputText component is added and the content is displayed on the same page.

# Expected behavior
The generated HTML code for the index component should be ``<input id="Test">``. But the generated code consists of ``<input id="Test"></input>``, which violates html specs. It can be reproduced by copying the generated source code into the W3C validator.
